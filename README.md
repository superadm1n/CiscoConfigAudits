# CiscoConfigAudits
Each of the files in this repository is a script that will preform a specific audit on the configuration 
from a Cisco device. These scripts are written in python and at this point leverage the CiscoConfParse 
library as a dependancy.


All of the scripts in this repository are created with the Unix philosophy in mind to do one thing 
and do it well, and work together well with other programs.
